# Ted
This is to store all of my Voron V0 3D printer stuff, including automated backups using KIAUH and other stuff.
One important thing to note is that the autcomplete script doesn't track deletions. 


To backup config files manually (run with `bash` NOT `sh`:
```
cd ~/Ted
bash autocommit.sh

```

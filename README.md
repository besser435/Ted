# Ted
This is to store all of my Voron V0 3D printer stuff, including automated backups using the KIAUH gcode shell extention, and some other stuff like firmware and slicer profiles.
One important thing to note is that the autocommit script doesn't track deletions. 


To backup config files manually (run with `bash` NOT `sh`:
```
cd ~/Ted
bash autocommit.sh

```
